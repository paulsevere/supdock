# Supdock-GO
This is the Golang version of Supdock, which I'm using as a way to get to know the language.

What's Up, Dock(er)? A slightly more visual way to interact with the docker daemon. Supdock is a wrapper for the docker command meaning you can still use all of the other `docker` commands without issues.

## Why
Repetitive use of `docker ps`, `docker logs`, `docker stats` and `docker exec -ti` when troubleshooting  complex container setups can get chaotic. Supdock aims to optimize and speed up your workflow using docker.
